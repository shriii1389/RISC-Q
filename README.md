# RISC-Q
A RISC-V project for Computer Organization &amp; Design. Prototype of a Programming Language designed to execute Gate-Level Operations on RISC-V. It currently supports qubit load/store and gate application. Future work planned; contributions welcome!

The code has been built on RAS, and to be run with the same. Please run the main file to launch the interpreter.
